# Hanno's Playbook

##[The wiki](https://github.com/wearehanno/playbook/wiki)

This is the main bit. We're trying to get this to be as comprehensive as possible, and migrate everything away from being inside The Hanno Manual, internlly.

It's currently private, but we'll probably open-source it later on.

##The [Playbook website](http://playbook.hanno.co).

This is supposed to be a slightly higher general overview, so that clients and potential hires will read through it. It's hosted on Github Pages and is automatically 'deployed' as soon as you commit to the default `gh-pages` branch.

It shows up at [playbook.hanno.co](http://playbook.hanno.co).

DNS hosting is taken care of over at hover.com.

### How to use it

Clone this repository, and then run `jekyll -w serve` inside the directory.

All your changes will be deployed to the live Playbook when you push to the repo.
